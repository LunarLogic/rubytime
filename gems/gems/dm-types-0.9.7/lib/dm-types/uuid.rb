    # UUID Type
    # First run at this, because I need it. A few caveats:
    #  * Only works on postgres, using the built-in native uuid type.
    #    To make it work in mysql, you'll have to add a typemap entry to
    #    the mysql_adapter. I think. I don't have mysql handy, so I'm
    #    not going to try. For SQLite, this will have to inherit from the
    #    String primitive
    #  * Won't accept a random default, because of the namespace clash
    #    between this and the UUIDtools gem. Also can't set the default
    #    type to UUID() (postgres-contrib's native generator) and
    #    automigrate, because auto_migrate! tries to make it a string "UUID()"
    # Feel free to enchance this, and delete these caveats when they're fixed.
