Please update this file and increment Application::JSON_API_VERSION if any changes are made to the JSON API (this
includes only the functionality used by external clients (Plasma widget, iPhone app, etc.) - JSON methods used by AJAX
actions are irrelevant in this context).

This is done so that it's possible to handle incompatibilities between client and server versions (e.g. iPhone app has
been updated to the newest version which uses some new API actions, but the server wasn't).
