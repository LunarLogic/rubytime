h2. Setup

h3. Prerequisites

You need to have Ruby version 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 and Rubygems 1.3 installed on your server. If you don't have Rubygems installed get it at "http://www.rubygems.org":http://www.rubygems.org.

h3. Get the source

Next get the source code from Rubytime github repository (the 3.1.1 branch):

bc. git clone git://github.com/LunarLogicPolska/rubytime.git
cd rubytime
git checkout origin/3.1.1

h3. Install gems

* make sure that Github is in your gem sources: @gem sources -a http://gems.github.com@
* install gems: @html5@, @chronic@, @bartes-rcov_stats@, @jscruggs-metric_fu@ (any version)
* install datamapper gems: @sudo gem install datamapper -v 0.9.11@
* install merb gems: @sudo gem install merb -v 1.0.11@
** if this fails because of merb-slices, then install the version it asks for, e.g. @sudo gem install merb-slices -v 1.0.12@ and try again
* install @addressable 2.0.2@, @dm-constraints 0.9.9@, @icalendar 1.1.0@
* install @do_mysql 0.9.11@
** you may have to add some options to make sure it's compiled for proper architecture and that it finds mysql headers (e.g. on Mac try: @sudo env ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64' gem install do_mysql -v 0.9.11 -- --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config@ to install a version for 64-bit architecture (10.5/10.6) and for MySQL in /usr/local/mysql (installed from DMG))
* make sure that @data_objects@ gem is installed only in version @0.9.11@
* if anything other fails, @merb -v@ should help you figure out what's wrong

h3. Configure

Enter application directory:

bc. cd rubytime

Then:

 * copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml, then edit it to match your database configuration
 * copy config/local_config.rb.example to config/local_config.rb, then set application domain and mailer "From" address
 * run @MERB_ENV=production rake db:automigrate@ to create database structure
 * run @MERB_ENV=production rake rubytime:kickstart@ to populate database tables with initial data (admin account, example clients and projects)

h3. Run

Run the application:

bc. merb

Point your browser to url set in config/local/config.rb and login as @admin@ with password @password@

h2. iPhone app

There is an iPhone app for RubyTime, called iRubyTime, "also available on GitHub":http://github.com/psionides/iRubyTime. You can also download it from "the AppStore":http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/irubytime/id355303566?mt=8. You need RubyTime 3.1.1 or later if you want to use iRubyTime.
