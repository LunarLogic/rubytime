TODO before 3.3 release:

* test it again, fix any new bugs

* update iRubyTime and Plasmoid (?)

=====

After 3.3 (in any order):

* convert CSS to LESS

* refactor existing code
  - specs are in rather good shape now, but helpers, javascripts and some controllers definitely need some work too
  - also, look for things marked #TODO :)

* migrate to Rails 3

* for deployment, switch from Vlad to Capistrano

* prepare some basic documentation to help new developers

* fix minor bugs, implement new features
