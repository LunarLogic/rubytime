Things to do (in any order):

* convert CSS to LESS

* refactor existing code
  - specs are in rather good shape now, but helpers, javascripts and some controllers definitely need some work too
  - also, look for things marked #TODO :)
  - look for actions which make too many queries and optimize them

* migrate to Rails 3

* for deployment, switch from Vlad to Capistrano

* fix minor bugs, implement new features

* use 'whenever' for configuring scheduled tasks (timesheet reports etc.)

* find a way of writing real migrations in DataMapper to migrate data
