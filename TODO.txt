TODO before 3.3 release:

* the tests are completely unstable at the moment; entire test suite needs to be refactored & fixed:
  -> work in the "refactor" branch
  -> replace calls to fixtures with calls to factories (factory_girl; use our custom helpers generate()/prepare())
  -> remove all code related to generating and loading fixtures
  -> turn off transactional tests, and clear the database after every test

* upgrade to latest Merb and DataMapper (+ fix tests again if they break)

* merge 3.2 branch

* fix all critical bugs from Pivotal/Kanbanery

* ask Wojtek or Kuba Obstarczyk to test it again

* when there are no more critical bugs -> release 3.3

=====

After 3.3 (in any order):

* convert CSS to LESS

* upgrade jQuery to 1.4

* migrate to Rails 3

* prepare some basic documentation to help new developers

* fix minor bugs, implement new features
