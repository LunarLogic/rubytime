TODO before 3.2 release:

* release version 3.1.1
  -> create a new branch based on latest stable release (the one currently at rt.llp.pl)
  -> cherry-pick commits from master related to iPhone support and minor bug fixes that won't affect anything else
  -> test a bit and release to rt.llp.pl

* the tests are completely unstable at the moment; entire test suite needs to be refactored & fixed:
  -> work in the "refactor" branch
  -> replace calls to fixtures with calls to factories (factory_girl; use our custom helpers gen()/make())
  -> remove all code related to generating and loading fixtures
  -> turn off transactional tests, and clear the database after every test

* upgrade Merb to 1.1 ('pre' version, if final doesn't come out by then)

* once the test suite is stable, and DM & Merb are updated: fix all critical bugs from Pivotal/Kanbanery

* perform thorough QA testing again

* when there are no more critical bugs -> release 3.2

=====

After 3.2 (in any order):

* convert CSS to LESS

* upgrade jQuery to 1.4

* migrate to Rails 3

* prepare some basic documentation to help new developers

* fix minor bugs, implement new features
